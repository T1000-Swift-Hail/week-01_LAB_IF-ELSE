## Using your Xcode IDE , create a new playground "conditionals" , and follow the steps:

- Create a  constant, name it: colorBlue = "Blue"
- Create a second constant, name it: colorRed = "Red"
- Create a third constant , name it: colorPicked = "Red"
- Create a condition using if else, check if colorPicked == "Blue" , then print "Not the picked color!"
- else if colorPicked == "Red", then print "Yes! this is the picked color"


##Bonus
Add an else statement to print a default value : "color picked is not known". Try to change the colorPicked to value "bird".
